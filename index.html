                        <p>However, at a ratio of 30.4 students to one teacher, the United States in 2019 had the 8th highest student-to-teacher ratio compared to other developed nations. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may have increased this ratio, for as teachers leave their jobs due to stress, those who remain must take on additional students [A]. </p>
                        <p>Altogether, this means more on-the-job stress and more uncontracted hours, all for the same amount of pay, which contributes to both more stress on the teacher’s part and lower quality one-on-one education for the students. </p>
